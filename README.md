# Travel Planner

The repo contains the build of Trip Planner, which is your planner for trip-making decisions. The application provides a suite of advanced agents that help you plan your favorite destination vacation. The sophisticated multi-agent system leverages advanced machine learning algorithms and large language models (LLMs) to provide precise and actionable itineraries according to your preferences.

Just enter the name of the location you want to visit and leave the rest to our travel experts. The multi-agent team combines the expertise of a city selection expert, a local expert and your very own travel concierge. They work collaboratively to find cities with the best activities, weather, food, and sight-seeing to help you make the best-informed decisions.
